It was interesting what happened with the people. 
They lay bitten on the battlefield 
and only turned after several hours. After they 
turn their souls walk aimlessly among the bloodstains, 
their bodies lay riddled with bullets. It's strange 
how something as innocuous as a handful of teeth marks can 
utterly destroy a man. 
 
The infected had been loaded with a plague bomb  and the 
battle was about to begin. It could be said that the infected 
ball was the ultimate weapon. The cannon's power 
was undeniable. 
 
Although a formidable weapon, the pitchfork did nothing 
to stop the zombie from uprising. 
 
Leiche Arthas saw only GLOOM in the faces of the people. 
They were a GLOOMy folk, who were seeking refuge in a 
place that was well-lit, unGLOOMy even; lifting their 
most somber of moods. 
 
To say the zombie were HAPPY would be an outright lie. 
They were more unHAPPY here than anywhere else in the world. 
They wished to vAnIsH into the darkness, and in doing so 
would find that the world vAnIsHes around them. For vAnIsHing 
would be ideal, since continuing to see and be seen in this 
war-torn world was too much for their fragile psyche.
