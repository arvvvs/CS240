It was interesting what happened with the people.
They lay wounded on the battlefield
and only died after several hours. After they
die their souls walk aimlessly among the bloodstains,
their bodies lay riddled with bullets. It's strange
how something as innocuous as a handful of bullets can
utterly destroy a man.

The cannon had been loaded with a cannon ball and the
battle was about to begin. It could be said that the cannon
ball was the ultimate weapon. The cannon's power
was undeniable.

Although a formidable weapon, the bayonet did nothing
to stop the people from uprising.

Prince Arthas saw only gloom in the faces of the people.
They were a gloomy folk, who were seeking refuge in a
place that was well-lit, ungloomy even; lifting their
most somber of moods.

To say the people were happy would be an outright lie.
They were more unhappy here than anywhere else in the world.
They wished to vanish into the darkness, and in doing so
would find that the world vanishes around them. For vanishing
would be ideal, since continuing to see and be seen in this
war-torn world was too much for their fragile psyche.
